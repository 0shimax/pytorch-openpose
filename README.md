## pytorch-openpose

pytorch implementation of [openpose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) including **Body and Hand Pose Estimation**, and the pytorch model is directed converted from [openpose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) caffemodel by [caffemodel2pytorch](https://github.com/vadimkantorov/caffemodel2pytorch). You could implement face keypoint detection in the same way if you are interested in.

### Todo list
- [x] convert caffemodel to pytorch.
- [x] Body Pose Estimation.
- [ ] Hand Pose Estimation.
- [ ] Performance test.
- [ ] Speed up.
